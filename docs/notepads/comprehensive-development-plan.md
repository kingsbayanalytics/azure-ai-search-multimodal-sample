# Azure Multimodal RAG Production Development Plan
## Comprehensive Step-by-Step Implementation Strategy

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This development plan focuses on two main development streams:

1. **Primary Strategy**: Build a **separate cost-effective preprocessing pipeline** using Python libraries (PyMuPDF, PDFPlumber, SentenceTransformers) to create Azure Search indexes 70-85% cheaper than Azure Document Intelligence Skills
2. **Secondary Strategy**: **Modify the existing app** to consume Azure Prompt Flow endpoints instead of direct AI Search/OpenAI calls

**Key Separation**: The preprocessing pipeline is completely separate from the app. The app will continue to consume Azure Search indexes (just cheaper ones) and optionally switch to Prompt Flow endpoints for orchestration.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Cost-Effective Index Creation**: Build preprocessing pipeline achieving 70-85% cost reduction vs Azure Document Intelligence
2. **App Prompt Flow Integration**: Modify existing app to consume Prompt Flow endpoints while preserving visual citations
3. **Visual Citation Preservation**: Maintain PDF highlighting and image citation capabilities through both strategies
4. **Production Readiness**: Enterprise-ready deployment for both preprocessing and app components
5. **Scalability**: Support enterprise document processing volumes with cost optimization
